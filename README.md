Tips: 
There are 3 types of cards: Environment, Monsters, Magic. And 4 elements. Accent color of cards tells to which element it belongs. Tap on cards to see them closer. 

Environment cards change current Element. It affects other cards abilities to attack and defend. Only one Environment card can be active. If you place and activate new, the previous one would be discarded. 

Magic cards has a strong attack, especially when used in a suitable environment. But they can only be used once. After activation magic cards are discarded. 

Monster cards can be used multiple times, they restore each turn. If they're not activated in that round, they use their defense powers to lower attack rate. Weakness element lowers attack ability, Resist element raises defense. 

This is solo project targeted at compo, but I've decided to take additional 24h to polish a bit. I'll be glad to answer your questions and very appreciate any feedback. Thanks!
